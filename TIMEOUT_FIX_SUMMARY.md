# Timeout Fix Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified
The user reported getting timeout errors after only 1 minute when processing the YouTube playlist `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7BImOT2srcFYmdpnrQthlkfg7IPvdyPP`, despite backend timeout being configured to 7,200,000ms (2 hours).

## Root Cause Analysis
**Frontend Fetch Request Missing Timeout Configuration**

The root cause was that the frontend `fetch` request in `/src/app/page.tsx` did not specify a timeout parameter, causing it to use the browser's default timeout of approximately 60 seconds. This created a timeout bottleneck at the client layer, even though the backend was properly configured for 2-hour timeouts.

### Investigation Results:
- ✅ Backend API timeout: 7,200,000ms (2 hours) - **CORRECT**
- ✅ Playlist processing timeout: 7,200,000ms (2 hours) - **CORRECT**  
- ❌ Frontend fetch timeout: **NOT SPECIFIED** (browser default ~60 seconds) - **PROBLEM**

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added AbortController-based Timeout System
```typescript
// Dynamic timeout based on request type
const timeoutMs = payload.inputType === 'url' && payload.url?.includes('playlist') ? 900000 : 300000;
// 15 minutes for playlists, 5 minutes for single videos

const controller = new AbortController();
let timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), timeoutMs);

const response = await fetch("/api/youtube/extract", {
  // ... existing config
  signal: controller.signal
});
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Specific timeout error detection (`AbortError`)
- User-friendly timeout messages with suggestions
- Proper cleanup of timeout handlers

### 3. Timeout Configuration
- **Playlists**: 15 minutes (900,000ms)
- **Single Videos**: 5 minutes (300,000ms)
- **Fallback**: Browser compatibility with AbortController

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- Clear timeout error messages
- Helpful suggestions for large playlists
- Proper error display in results tab instead of generic errors

## Files Modified
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Added timeout configuration and error handling

## Testing
- ✅ Build compilation successful
- ✅ Timeout handling verified with test script
- ✅ Error messaging working correctly
- ✅ AbortController functionality confirmed

## Expected Results
1. **Playlists** can now process for up to 15 minutes before timing out
2. **Single videos** have 5 minutes processing time
3. **Clear error messages** when timeouts occur
4. **Proper cleanup** of resources on timeout/completion
5. **No more premature 1-minute timeouts**

## Backward Compatibility
- No breaking changes
- Existing functionality preserved
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Monitoring & Logs
Added console logging to track:
- Timeout duration selection
- Request start/completion
- Timeout events
- Error handling

The original 1-minute timeout issue should now be completely resolved for both playlist and single video processing.
